We got our food without rice, but didn't have anything to point to - we thought about how we can communicate that.\r\n\r\n> This is when it hit us: We didn't have an internet connection to just google for rice. But what do we all have locally? Emojis :arrow_right: :rice:\r\n\r\n### Implementation\r\n\r\nThemoji is a super simple application, you search for an emoji and it will be displayed full-screen on your iPhone. You can then show this to your waitress, bartender or other locals.\r\n\r\n### Example uses\r\n\r\n#### Communicating while traveling\r\n\r\n- Order another beer: :beer: (or any other food and drink)\r\n- Ask for the way to \r\n  - Train Station :steam_locomotive:\r\n  - Airport :airplane:\r\n  - Hospital :hospital:\r\n  - Attractions in the city :ferris_wheel: \r\n- Ask for :scissors: or a :pencil2: \r\n- Get some batteries :battery: \r\n\r\n#### Fun stuff for the young kids\r\n\r\nYour iPhone becomes an emoji basically. You can take pictures with you and any emoji next to you: \r\n- on the beach with :sunglasses:\r\n- sleepy on the airplane :sleeping:\r\n- eating burgers :hamburger: \r\n\r\nHave any more ideas?
